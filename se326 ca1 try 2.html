<h3>About The paint balling:-</h3>

          <p>Paintball is a competitive team shooting sport in which players eliminate opponents from play by hitting them with spherical dye-filled gelatin capsules called paintballs that break upon impact. Paintballs are usually shot using low-energy air weapons called paintball markers that are powered by compressed air (nitrogen) or carbon dioxide and were originally designed for remotely marking trees and cattle<br>The game was invented in May 1981 in New Hampshire by Hayes Noel, a Wall Street stock trader, and Charles Gaines, an outdoorsman and writer.
<br> A debate arose between them about whether a city-dweller had the instinct to survive in the woods against a man who had spent his youth hunting, fishing, and building cabins. The two men chanced upon an advertisement for a paint gun in a farm catalogue and were inspired to use it to settle their argument with 10 other men all in individual competition, eventually creating the sport of paintball

The sport is played for recreation and is also played at a formal sporting level with organized competition that involves major tournaments, professional teams, and playersPaintball technology is also used by military forces, law enforcement, paramilitary, and security organizations to supplement military or other training.

Games can be played on indoor or outdoor fields of varying sizes</p>
